# Blackjack Python Game

## Description

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic casino card game Blackjack, also known as 21. The game allows players to play against a computer-controlled dealer. Players are dealt cards and must decide whether to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player with the highest hand value without busting (exceeding 21) wins the round.

## Features

- Player vs. Computer gameplay.
- Standard Blackjack rules, including hitting, standing, and busting.
- Basic card scoring and hand evaluation.
- Simple ASCII art for card representation.
- Interactive command-line interface for player input.
